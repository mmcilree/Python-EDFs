# Python-EDFs
This a collection of Python functionalities for working with EDFs and SEDFs and their images under a homormorphism.

Most of the basic functions are in ```setfamily.py``. This define objects for the various structures under consideration, and methods for checking whether they are an EDF, SEDF etc. as well as printing differences and tables in LaTeX form. 

```test_edfs``` contains some basic EDFs and SEDFs as arrays for testing purposes, and the rest of the files represent various experiments.
